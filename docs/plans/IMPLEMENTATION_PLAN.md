# Implementation Plan

All phases of the Discord Go SDK project (Phase 1–7) have been completed: types, webhook, rate limiting, gateway, advanced permissions/embeds/utilities, resilience, CLI integration, and documentation/release.  
See the `docs/guides/` directory for detailed guides (`AGENTS.md` links to each), and refer to the changelog (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`) for release notes.  
Future work should live in new plans or open questions; treat this document as the completed status summary.
